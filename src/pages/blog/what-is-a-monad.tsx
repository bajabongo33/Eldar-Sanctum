          In the philosophy of Eldar Sanctum, a Monad is a singular, indivisible unit of consciousness â€” a seed of awareness from which all experience grows. The Monad is both the root and the crown of the knowledge tree, a point of origin and a destination.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          To understand the Monad is to glimpse the unity behind all diversity, the light within the forest of forms.
